# Catppuccin — Mocha theme for eM Client

A Catppuccin "Mocha" color theme for [eM Client](https://www.emclient.com/), created and maintained by @egoexpress.

This repository contains a ready-to-use theme that applies the Catppuccin Mocha color palette and styling to eM Client so your mail client looks warm, soft, and consistent with the Catppuccin aesthetic.

## Contents

- Theme file(s) for eM Client
- Optional assets (icons, screenshots) in `assets/`
- This README

## Requirements

- eM Client 10 and later
- This theme is based on the official Catppuccin color palette from [@catppuccin/catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
   - Example: `git clone https://github.com/egoexpress/emclient-theme-catppuccin.git`

2. Locate the theme file in this repository. Theme files for eM Client are typically provided as a single file (check for filenames in the repo such as `catppuccin-mocha.*` or inspect the `themes/` directory).

3. Open eM Client.
   - Depending on your version, go to `Menu` → `Settings` → `Appearance` (or `Tools` → `Settings` → `Appearance`).
   - Look for Theme or Appearance options and choose `Import` (or similar).
   - Select the theme file you downloaded from this repository and import it.

4. Apply the imported theme and restart eM Client if prompted.

Notes:
- Menu labels and exact paths may differ slightly between eM Client versions. If you can't find the import option, check eM Client's help or preferences for "theme" or "appearance".
- After importing, you can switch between themes in the same Appearance/Theme settings area.

## Uninstall / Revert

- To remove or revert the theme, open eM Client Appearance settings and switch to another theme or restore defaults.
- You can also remove the imported theme file from eM Client's themes folder if you wish (refer to eM Client documentation for the theme storage location on your OS).

## Customization & Development

If you want to adapt the theme (colors, spacing, fonts):

- Edit the theme XML file in this repository.
- Test changes by re-importing the edited theme into eM Client.
- If you use the Catppuccin upstream tokens or tooling, link back to [@catppuccin/catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) for palettes and generators.

If you'd like me to add a build script or generator to produce theme files automatically from Catppuccin tokens, open an issue or a PR describing the desired workflow.
